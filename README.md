This app leverages NASA's Open APIs to display stunning images and videos of the universe, earth and scientific events captured from high definition cameras, telescopes, rovers and satellites.

This project would not be possible without the incredible work of NASA and their commitment to making science discoveries accessible to everyone. Special thanks to the Open Innovation team for providing public APIs to these resources.
